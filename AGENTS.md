## Language Convention

This project may be released publicly. All of the following must be written in **English**:

- Commit messages
- Code comments
- Documentation (including `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, etc.)
- Test names
- Error messages

## Project Structure

- MoonBit packages are organized per directory; each directory contains a
  `moon.pkg` file listing its dependencies. Each package has its files and
  blackbox test files (ending in `_test.mbt`) and whitebox test files (ending in
  `_wbtest.mbt`).

- In the toplevel directory, there is a `moon.mod.json` file listing module
  metadata.

## Coding convention

- MoonBit code is organized in block style, each block is separated by `///|`,
  the order of each block is irrelevant. In some refactorings, you can process
  block by block independently.

- Try to keep deprecated blocks in file called `deprecated.mbt` in each
  directory.

## Tooling

- `moon fmt` is used to format your code properly.

- `moon ide` provides project navigation helpers like `peek-def`, `outline`, and
  `find-references`. See $moonbit-agent-guide for details.

- `moon info` is used to update the generated interface of the package, each
  package has a generated interface file `.mbti`, it is a brief formal
  description of the package. If nothing in `.mbti` changes, this means your
  change does not bring the visible changes to the external package users, it is
  typically a safe refactoring.

- In the last step, run `moon info && moon fmt` to update the interface and
  format the code. Check the diffs of `.mbti` file to see if the changes are
  expected.

- Run `moon test` to check tests pass. MoonBit supports snapshot testing; when
  changes affect outputs, run `moon test --update` to refresh snapshots.

- Prefer `assert_eq` or `assert_true(pattern is Pattern(...))` for results that
  are stable or very unlikely to change. Use snapshot tests to record current
  behavior. For solid, well-defined results (e.g. scientific computations),
  prefer assertion tests. You can use `moon coverage analyze > uncovered.log` to
  see which parts of your code are not covered by tests.

## Development Philosophy

### Red/Green TDD (Detroit school)

- Red → Green → Refactor cycle strictly followed
- Use real objects; mocks are only permitted at external boundaries (file system, external API, network)
- Write tests BEFORE implementation; run tests AFTER implementation
- Discuss coverage targets with the user before starting implementation

### Domain Object Design

- Rich domain objects: pair data and logic in the same type
- Prefer immutability; avoid mutable state unless necessary
- Distinguish entities (identity-based) from value objects (value-based)
- Enforce layer boundaries through abstract types; no direct dependency on concrete implementations

### Evergreen Tests

- Test names describe WHAT business rule is being verified, not HOW
- Test names must not reference implementation details
- Test code serves as living documentation of the system's behavior

### Code Comments

- Do NOT write code comments unless explicitly permitted by the user
- Let the code speak for itself; let tests document the behavior
- Code = How, Tests = What, Commit messages = Why

## Git Conventions

### Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `style` | Code style (formatting, whitespace) |
| `refactor` | Code change that is neither a fix nor a feature |
| `tidy` | Small, safe cleanup (< 2 min; no behavior change) |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, or config changes |
| `ci` | CI/CD pipeline changes (GitHub Actions, workflows) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |

### Scopes

Scope is optional; use the package name when the change targets a specific package (e.g., `uri`, `parser`). Omit for project-wide changes.

### Subject Line

- Use the imperative mood: "add", "fix", "remove" — not "added" or "adds"
- 72 characters max
- No trailing period

### Body (optional)

- Wrap at 72 characters
- Explain **why**, not what — the diff already shows what changed
- Leave one blank line between subject and body

### Footer (optional)

- `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>` for breaking changes
- `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456` to link issues

### Branch naming

`feature/xxx`, `fix/xxx`, `docs/xxx`
